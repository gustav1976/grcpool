			This wallet maintains the magnitude, receives the proof of research awards, and interest payments.
			Also the wallet handles the payouts to pool members. 
			<br/><br/>
			If you send coins to the staking wallet, you will effectively &quot;rain&quot; coins on the hosts in the pool.
			This is because payout amount is determined based on the <a href="/about/calculations">wallet balance, minus the basis and interest</a>.
			Also any project rain received into the staking wallet will be distributed to the hosts in the pool regardless of the project they are crunching on.
